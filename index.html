                <h2>on Surf Clubs</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>"information should be free" <br>it should be made accessible and at least shouldn't fry your
                        laptop</li>
                    <li>"freedom for users" <br>it's kinda interesting that this article focuses on the browsing journey
                        that people used to enjoy, which allows the extent of autonomy that is inviting and limitless.
                        Example used here was NFTs, but apparently
                        people are creating web-based NFT projects now</li>
                    <li>community <br> could be what the functional sites wouldn't prioritise. the del.icio.us site
                        succeeded to do with the tagging interaction, user engagement was fostered by 1.single function
                        2.archival feature. also theres just no ads
                        or algorithm(filter bubbles) that pushes you away
                    </li>
                    <li>"why web needs to be sheltered in web" <br>this could be tangent but another reading from Fred
                        Wilson about how space used to display artworks have significant affects on viewers perspective.
                        he experimented by framing three types
                        of exhibition space in "Room with a view: the struggle between cultural context and context of
                        art": the white cube, the small ethonographic museum, the turn-of-the-century salon space. all
                        pieces presented withou lable. found
                        out surprisingly that not only the viewers were confused but the curators and even the artists
                        were some extent intervened in terms of distinguishing and creating. web should stay perculiar
                        to the format it has always been embedded.
                    </li>
                    <li>"I understood this as the difference between the thing of beauty that was found online while
                        surfing - an image or ab it of information - and the <strong>journey</strong> towards a thing.
                        In myeyes, it enabled thinking about an
                        <strong>entire
                            conversation as an artwork</strong>, instead of a single argument, piece or comment.

                <h2>Jodi's Infrastructure</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>like last week's reading the essence of that web shouldn't be displayed in a gallery space for
                        that would bypass the peculiar digitality of web</li>
                    <li>-some programmers or engineers think of the machine as a tool to be used in pursuit of some
                        larger design strategy. digitailty is context or condition- it makes sense cause the art that
                        work 'within' the digitality can truly take off
                        from the dependence on the context. and i really like how art of code is portrayed here: art:
                        but code derives its beauty, its very identity, from an analysis of function and its accurate
                        formalization in logical and mathematical
                        structures
                    </li>
                    <li>infrastructural modernism: they are technologists who insist that the beauty of code comes from
                        function and elegance but from a different set of virtues - dysfunction and inelegance to be
                        sure, but also confusion and excitement, violence
                        and energy: the computer as medium: <br> this reminds me of this reading defining
                        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Pl5_DeU1vw1VysSUvqdq3RrSdb2Rod_/view?usp=sharing">new
                            media</a> that basically, numericial representation and automation are principling, it is
                        truly unique and self-driving devices that
                        reside in every corner in the internet world and its massive capacity gives you the freedom to:
                        make rules and let go of them. jodi's works have to live on the this medium.

                <details>
                    <summary> <a
                            href="https://whitney.org/exhibitions/programmed?section=3&subsection=3#exhibition-artworks"
                            id="art">W. Bradford Paley, CodeProfiles, 2002</a></summary>
                    <p>CodeProfiles looks at the computer program as text and visually comments on how code is read by
                        people, written by programmers, and executed by computers. Reflecting on its own construction,
                        the work consists of the code that makes
                        the code visible on the screen. Three points in code space are indicated: the amber line follows
                        the fixation point, tracing how people might read the text, line by line; the white line follows
                        the insertion point and flows like
                        the programmer’s thoughts, calmly in one place then jumping around to make other parts of the
                        code perform; and the green line moves along the execution point of the program, creating wide
                        swaths where the code was executed thousands
                        of times and appearing as a thin thread where the processor rarely visited. W. Bradford Paley
                        thereby foregrounds the conceptual nature of all digital art, which is always driven by a
                        language formulating instructions.</p>

                    <p>CodeProfiles looks at the computer program as text and visually comments on how code is read by people, written by programmers, and executed by computers. Reflecting on its own construction, the work consists of the code that makes
                        the code visible on the screen. Three points in code space are indicated: the amber line follows the fixation point, tracing how people might read the text, line by line; the white line follows the insertion point and flows like
                        the programmer’s thoughts, calmly in one place then jumping around to make other parts of the code perform; and the green line moves along the execution point of the program, creating wide swaths where the code was executed thousands
                        of times and appearing as a thin thread where the processor rarely visited. W. Bradford Paley thereby foregrounds the conceptual nature of all digital art, which is always driven by a language formulating instructions.</p>

                <p>Playfulness:

                    I think Control, Interaction, Transformation are the main factors of entertainment of life, sources
                    of joy and contentment. Games in that sense do sound like commercialised fantasy and I don’t see why
                    they are bad for your health.

                    <br><br>Engineering:

                    In details, the storytelling aspect of games is critically heightened.

                    "Interactivity is almost the opposite of narrative; narrative
                    flows under the direction of the author, while interactivity depends
                    on the player for motive power" --Ernest Adams
                    [(1)](http://web.mit.edu/~21fms/People/henry3/games&narrative.html?utm_campaign=Narrative%20Design&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#2)

                    The idea of nonlinear narrative and “interactive cinema” is fascinating, the prime framework of a
                    game setting should be included in the iteration of game design and that provides inspiration for
                    all disciplinary of design. I take this point from Henry Jenkins as main inspiration:

                    Many games *do* have narrative aspirations. Minimally, they want to tap the emotional residue of
                    previous narrative experiences. Often, they depend on our familiarity with the roles and goals of
                    genre entertainment to orientate us to the action, and in many cases, game designers want to create
                    a series of narrative experiences for the player. Given those narrative aspirations, it seems
                    reasonable to suggest that some understanding of how games relate to narrative is necessary before
                    we understand the aesthetics of game design or the nature of contemporary game culture.

                    How might computational approaches inform contemporary graphic design practices?

                    The use of mathematical calculations, or “computation,” is most commonly
                    associated with using algorithms in programming, and may at first seem
                    distant, if not daunting, for one who sets out to consider the
                    implications of using computation in design. What is certainly paramount
                    to the field of computer science, computation and computational
                    approaches are far from receiving neither widespread appreciation nor
                    comprehensive understanding when brought in tandem with graphic design. <br><br>

                    <br>P95 Alienated Science:

                    Everyday objects that ‘bear no apparent relation to art’ as aesthetic forms. Scientific pictures
                    that are used to obtain data or information is considered of utility, purpose and further boundary
                    for creating art. The solution to blur that boundary is to approach it with sheer pleasure in
                    graphic experiment: discarding professional ends, they begin to manipulate structures in conformity
                    with aesthetic notions.

                    "information ages." The first of these was a preliterate era, when people relied on the spoken word
                    to transmit their thoughts and memories. Claiming that in this time there was no distinct
                    information, as records and human action were inextricably entwined. During the second period,
                    literacy allowed people to create information, separate from narration. Systematic attempts to
                    classify this information created what the authors call an age of wisdom. Toward the end of this
                    period, the advent of the printed book made it possible to transmit accumulated facts and
                    classification schemes far more widely and uniformly. <br> <br>

                    Readymades reversed: as to index and protect the authorship of artworks⇒great, revolutionary
                    technical import⇒ such that they could overturn many common and unequal practices within the

                    <br><br>
                    History of art transforming into financial asset: While NFTs are reawakening interest in the
                    question of artistic value, the financialisation of cheaply made and mass-produced artworks has a
                    much longer history. Indeed, by the 1960s, a booming secondary art market that traded in
                    increasingly expensive, yet cheap-to-produce avant-garde works—often requiring relatively small
                    amounts of time and inexpensive materials—raised suspicions that art was becoming indistinguishable
                    from more traditional financial assets. In response, in 1968 the influential art critic Leo
                    Steinberg argued that, “avant-garde art, lately Americanized, is for the first time associated with
                    big money. … Another decade, and we shall have mutual funds based on securities in the form of
                    pictures held in bank vaults” (quoted in Beech 300). As Dave Beech has shown, in the ensuing period,
                    “art’s relationship to finance capital has outstripped Steinberg’s worst fears” (Beech 301). By the
                    1980s, banks allowed individuals to borrow large sums of money against the value of their art
                    collections, and investment in artworks became a normal practice of portfolio diversification (Beech
                    299–300). When interest rates are low, investments in productive capital offer low levels of
                    liquidity, and international markets appear vulnerable to shocks, artworks—whether physical or in
                    the form of an NFT—offer a means of hedging against future losses. Furthermore, in both the
                    contemporary art market and the NFT market, purchases of artworks at inflated prices often allow an
                    individual to prevent “the bottom from falling out of a market they have already invested in”
                    (O’Dwyer).
                    <br><br>
                    The fact that artworks could hold a value well in excess of the cost of the materials or labour time
                    required to produce them, was not solely recognised by art collectors and investors.

                    output by breaking processes into steps, and allowing the coordination

                    to way of thinking, living and seeing creative” this is quite of a synopsis what the several ideas
                    we have read in the past several weeks(i think) What computing is consist of that establish this way
                    of thinking: processing data and the development of user-friendly technologies. The production
                    possibilities entangled with technology, computer and the camera will rise the relationship of
                    existing between people. Essentially, inventing the way of living by imagining a new integrity of
                    technologies, culture, society, and anthropocene(too, maybe?).
