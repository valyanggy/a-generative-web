            <strong>reflection here:</strong>
            <h2>on Surf Clubs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>"information should be free" <br>it should be made accessible and at least shouldn't fry your laptop</li>
                <li>"freedom for users" <br>it's kinda interesting that this article focuses on the browsing journey that people used to enjoy, which allows the extent of autonomy that is inviting and limitless. Example used here was NFTs, but apparently
                    people are creating web-based NFT projects now</li>
                <li>community <br> could be what the functional sites wouldn't prioritise. the del.icio.us site succeeded to do with the tagging interaction, user engagement was fostered by 1.single function 2.archival feature. also theres just no ads or
                    algorithm(filter bubbles) that pushes you away
                </li>
                <li>"why web needs to be sheltered in web" <br>this could be tangent but another reading from Fred Wilson about how space used to display artworks have significant affects on viewers perspective. he experimented by framing three types of exhibition
                    space in "Room with a view: the struggle between cultural context and context of art": the white cube, the small ethonographic museum, the turn-of-the-century salon space. all pieces presented withou lable. found out surprisingly that
                    not only the viewers were confused but the curators and even the artists were some extent intervened in terms of distinguishing and creating. web should stay perculiar to the format it has always been embedded.
                </li>
                <li>"I understood this as the difference between the thing of beauty that was found online while surfing - an image or ab it of information - and the <strong>journey</strong> towards a thing. In myeyes, it enabled thinking about an <strong>entire
                    conversation as an artwork</strong>, instead of a single argument, piece or comment.</li>
